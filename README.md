A JSHint Chrome Developer Tools Extension. 

The extension will automatically run JSHint on JavaScript sources saved
in Chrome Dev Tools.

Unfortunately this extension uses currently experimental APIs, so cannot
be released on the Chrome App Store. You can download it [here](http://mrpotes.github.io/jshint-extension/)
